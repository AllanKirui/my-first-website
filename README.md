# NallaTronics landing page

This is the first website I ever built. At the time, I had just finished learning the fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3.

## Overview

### The challenge

I wanted to put all my basic skills together to build a project. I decided I was going to make a clone of [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/). The idea was for me to try to clone the site with a touch of my own designs and content.

I started working on the project on _30th November 2020_. I was on and off the project for the rest of _December_, but I'm glad I set aside some time and finished working on it on _9th January 2021_. I honestly believe that if I had abandoned the project, I wouldn't have started down this web development path.

What's in view:

-  At the top:

   -  a title icon I made for the page
   -  another custom logo I designed for the _Homepage_
   -  the first search bar I ever coded
   -  also, the first navigation bar I ever coded. At the time, I didn't even know to call it a navigation bar

-  At the center:
   -  some social icons I set to have a fixed position
   -  a hero message
   -  some circled out images (I had never worked with so many images in my life :D)

What's in view:

-  A section that features the month's top choices of parts for bulding a computer. I remember this section like it was just yesterday. I can never forget the headaches I got when trying to figure out they layout for this section.

## My process

### Built with

-  HTML5 markup
-  CSS
-  Flexbox
-  Desktop-first workflow
-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)

### What I learned

-  Being self taught is quite difficult. This was quite apparent as I was working on the project. I didn't know anyone who could have even remotely steered me in the right direction. It felt like I was fumbling in the dark when I was building this. I basically told myself, "No matter how long it takes, I'm going to finish this project," and so I did. I'm so proud of myself for never giving up.

-  I remember when I started, I had no idea what a navigation bar was. If I were to ask someone for help back then, I would have said something along the lines of, "Hey, how do I make this _menu_ look good on mobile?" :D

-  Overall, this project gave me a chance to combine everything I knew at the time about **HTML** and **CSS**, into something beautiful.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
